* Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)
	$\text{FiLM}(x_iâ€‹,\gamma,\beta)=\gamma_iâ€‹â‹…x_iâ€‹+\beta_iâ€‹$
	* $\text{FiLM}$ dynamically adjusts neural network feature representations using scaling and shifting parameters generated from conditional inputs.


* Logistic Cumulative Distribution Function (Logistic CDF)
	A sigmoid-shaped curve commonly used in binary classification tasks, especially in logistic regression, to estimate the probability of an event occurring.


* **Bayesian Inference**
	$$
	p(z|x)=\frac{p(x|z)\cdot p(z)}{p(x)}
	$$
	* $x$ is the **data**
	* $z$ is the **variable**
	* $p(xâˆ£z)$ is the **likelihood** function, representing the probability of the data $x$ given the latent variable $z$
	* $p(z)$ is the **prior** distribution
	* $p(z|x)$ is the **posterior** distribution
	* $p(x)$ is the **marginal likelihood** of the observed data, usually obtained by integrating over all possible values of $z$ : $p(x) = \int p(x|z)p(z)dz$


* **Variational Inference**
