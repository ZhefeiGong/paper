* ##### ✨Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)
	$\text{FiLM}(x_i​,\gamma,\beta)=\gamma_i​⋅x_i​+\beta_i​$
	* $\text{FiLM}$ dynamically adjusts neural network feature representations using scaling and shifting parameters generated from conditional inputs.

* ##### ✨Logistic Cumulative Distribution Function (Logistic CDF)
	* A sigmoid-shaped curve commonly used in binary classification tasks, especially in logistic regression, to estimate the probability of an event occurring.

* ##### ✨Mixture Density Networks (MDN)
	* A type of **neural network** designed to model **conditional probability** distributions using **a mixture of distributions** (often **Gaussian** distributions)
	* Unlike typical regression models that predict a single output value, MDNs output **parameters** for **a mixture of probability distributions**, capturing **uncertainty** or **multiple modes** in the data.
	* Suppose we model the conditional distribution $p(y | x)$ using a mixture of $K$ Gaussian distributions. Each Gaussian component $k$ is characterized by a mean $\mu_k(x)$, a variance $\sigma_k^2(x)$, and a mixture coefficient $\pi_k(x)$, all of which are functions of the input $x$.
		* The **probability density function** for the mixture is given by : $p(y | x) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k(x) \cdot \mathcal{N}\left( y; \mu_k(x), \sigma_k^2(x) \right)$
			* $π_k​(x)$ are the mixture coefficients (also called **weights**), representing the probability of selecting the $k$-th component. These coefficients must satisfy: $\sum​_{k=1}^K\pi_k​(x)=1$ and $0\leq\pi_k​(x)\leq1$
			* $\mathcal{N}(y; \mu_k(x), \sigma_k^2(x))$ is the probability density function of a Gaussian (normal) distribution with mean $\mu_k(x)$ and variance $\sigma_k^2(x)$, evaluated at $y$. The Gaussian PDF is given by: $\mathcal{N}(y; \mu_k(x), \sigma_k^2(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma_k^2(x)}} \exp\left( - \frac{(y - \mu_k(x))^2}{2 \sigma_k^2(x)} \right)$
		* The loss function in MDNs is the **negative log-likelihood** of the observed data given the predicted mixture of distributions.
			* For a single data point $(x_i, y_i)$, the loss is: $\mathcal{L}(x_i, y_i) = -\log \left( \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k(x_i) \cdot \mathcal{N}(y_i; \mu_k(x_i), \sigma_k^2(x_i)) \right)$


## 🧮 Probability

* ##### ✨**Bayesian Inference**
	
	$p(z|x)=\frac{p(x|z)\cdot p(z)}{p(x)}$
	
	* $x$ is the **data**
	* $z$ is the **variable**
	* $p(x|z)$ is the **likelihood** function, representing the probability of the data $x$ given the latent variable $z$
	* $p(z)$ is the **prior** distribution
	* $p(z|x)$ is the **posterior** distribution
	* $p(x)$ is the **marginal likelihood** of the observed data, usually obtained by integrating over all possible values of $z$ : $p(x) = \int p(x|z)p(z)dz$


* ##### ✨Normal Distribution | Gaussian Distribution
	When we refer to a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, we are specifically talking about the standard normal distribution.
	
	* A random variable $X$ is said to be normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ if its **probability dense function(PDF)** is given by : $f(x|\mu,\sigma)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}​​exp(−\frac{(x−\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})$
	
	* The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is : $\Phi(x)=P(X\leq x)=\int{x}{-\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}exp(-\frac{t^2}{2})dt$


* ##### ✨Bernoulli Distribution
	It describes the outcome of a single trial experiment that results in a binary outcome: success (usually coded as 1) or failure (usually coded as 0). This distribution is named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli.
	
	* A random variable $X$ follows a Bernoulli distribution if it takes the value $1$ with probability $p$ (success) and the value $0$ with probability $1−p$ (failure). The **probability mass function (PMF)** of a Bernoulli distributed random variable is given by : $f(X=x)=\begin{cases} p &\text{if}\ x=1 \\ 1-p &\text{if}\ x=0 \end{cases}$
	
	* Mean(Expected Value) : $E[X]=p$
	
	* Variance : $Var[X]=p(1-p)$
	
	* Standard Deviation : $\sigma_{X}=\sqrt{p(1-p)}$


* ##### ✨Uniform Distribution
	It describes a continuous probability distribution where every possible outcome has an equal likelihood of occurring within a given range.
	
	* A random variable $X$ is uniformly distributed over the interval $[a,b]$ if its **probability density function (PDF)** is given by : $f(x|a,b)=\begin{cases} \frac{1}{b-a} &\text{if}\ a\leq x \leq b \\ 0 &\text{otherwise}\  \end{cases}$
	
	* The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** $F(x)$ of a uniformly distributed random variable $X$ over $[a,b]$ is : $F(x)=\begin{cases} 0 &\text{for}\ x <a \\ \frac{x-a}{b-a} &\text{for}\ a\leq x \leq b \\ 1 &\text{for}\ a > b \end{cases}$
	
	* The **mean (expected value)** of a uniform distribution over $[a, b]$ is : $E[X]=\frac{a+b}{2}$
	
	* The **variance** of $X$ is : $Var(X)=\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$


* ✨ **MAP Inference**
	**MAP Inference (Maximum A Posteriori Inference)** is a fundamental concept in probabilistic models, particularly in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. It involves finding the most likely parameters or states given observed data, under a probabilistic model : 
	$z_{MAP}​=arg \max_{z} \ ​p(z|\mathbf{X})$
	$=arg \max_{z} \frac{p(\mathbf{X}|z)p(z)}{p(\mathbf{X})}$
	$= arg \max_{z} \ p(\mathbf{X}|z)p(z)$


* ✨ **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**
	**MLE** focuses solely on maximizing the likelihood $p(\mathbf{X}|z)$, assuming no prior knowledge about $z$ : $z_{MLE}​=arg \max_{z} \ ​p(\mathbf{X}|z)$


* ✨ **Markov Chain (MC)**
	MCMC is based on the theory of Markov chains. A Markov chain is a stochastic process with the "memoryless" property, meaning that the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of states that preceded it. Formally, if $x_0,x_1,x_2,…$ is a Markov chain, then the transition probability satisfies: $P(x_{t+1}​|x_{t}​,x_{t−1}​,…,x_0​)=P(x_{t+1}​|x_{t}​)$


* ✨ **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**
	* The core idea of MCMC is to construct a Markov chain that has the desired target distribution as its stationary distribution. 
	* By running this chain for a sufficient number of steps, we can generate samples that approximate the target distribution. 
	* The general steps of an MCMC algorithm are as follows:
		1. **Initialization**: Choose an initial state $x_0$​.
		2. **Generate a Candidate Sample**: Based on the current state $x_t$​, generate a candidate state $x_{t+1}$​.
		3. **Accept-Reject Rule**: Use a rule to decide whether to accept the candidate sample $x_{t+1}$​ as the new state. If accepted, move to $x_{t+1}$​; otherwise, remain at $x_t$​.
		4. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a sufficient number of samples are generated.


* ✨ **InfoNCE**
	* **Information Noise-Contrastive Estimation** is a **loss** function commonly used in contrastive learning, especially within self-supervised learning frameworks. The purpose of **InfoNCE** is to distinguish **positive pairs** from **negative pairs**. By optimizing this loss function, models can learn to encode meaningful representations of data **without requiring labeled examples**.
	
	* Let $q$ be a query sample, $k^+$ be the positive sample corresponding to $q$, and $\{k_1^{-}, k_2^{-}, \cdots, k_K^{-} \}$ represent $K$ negative samples. The **InfoNCE** loss is defined as : $\mathcal{L}_{\text{InfoNCE}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(q, k^+) / \tau)}{\exp(\text{sim}(q, k^+) / \tau) + \sum_{i=1}^{K} \exp(\text{sim}(q, k_i^-) / \tau)}$
		where
		* $\text{sim}(q,k)$ measures the similarity between the query sample $q$ and a sample $k$, typically using dot product or cosine similarity : $\text{sim}(q, k) = \frac{q \cdot k}{\|q\| \|k\|}$
		* $\tau$ is the temperature parameter, which adjusts the concentration of the similarity distribution. Lower values of $\tau$ make the distribution more peaked, emphasizing distinctions between positive and negative pairs.
		* $k^{+}$ is the positive sample associated with the query $q$.
		* $k_i^{−}$​ are the negative samples not related to the query $q$.


* ##### ✨ **Energy-Based Models**
	* **Energy-Based Models (EBMs)** are a class of **probabilistic models** that are used to capture the **dependencies** between variables by associating a scalar energy to each configuration of the variables. 
	* In **EBMs**, lower energy values correspond to more likely configurations, and the probability of a configuration is derived from its energy.
	
	* In an **Energy-Based Model**, the probability distribution over a set of variables $\mathbf{x}$ is defined by an energy function $E(\mathbf{x})$, where lower energy corresponds to higher probability. The probability distribution is given by **the Boltzmann distribution** : $P(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{e^{-E(\mathbf{x})}}{Z}$
		where :
		* $E(\mathbf{x})$ is the **energy function** that maps configurations $\mathbf{x}$ to a scalar value.
		* $Z$ is the **partition function**, which normalizes the distribution and is defined as : $Z = \sum_{\mathbf{x}} e^{-E(\mathbf{x})}$
		* The partition function $Z$ sums over all possible configurations of $\mathbf{x}$ and ensures that the probabilities sum to 1.
	* The **choice** of the energy function $E(\mathbf{x})$ is crucial, as it determines the shape of the probability distribution. It is typically parameterized by a set of parameters $\theta$ : $E(\mathbf{x}; \theta)$
	
	* **Training** **EBMs** involves finding the parameters $\theta$ that **minimize** the **discrepancy** between the model distribution $P(\mathbf{x})$ and the true data distribution $P_{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x})$. This is often done using **maximum likelihood estimation**, which requires computing the gradient of the **log-likelihood** with respect to the parameters $\theta$ : $\frac{\partial \log P(\mathbf{x}; \theta)}{\partial \theta} = -\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{x}; \theta)}{\partial \theta} + \mathbb{E}_{P(\mathbf{x}; \theta)}\left[\frac{\partial E(\mathbf{x}; \theta)}{\partial \theta}\right]$


* ##### ✨ **KL divergence**
	* **Kullback-Leibler divergence** is a measure of how **one** probability distribution diverges from a **second**, reference probability distribution. It is a **non-symmetric** measure that quantifies the difference between two probability distributions $P$ and $Q$.
	* In information theory, KL divergence is often interpreted as the amount of information lost when $Q$ **is used to approximate** $P$. A **lower** KL divergence indicates that $Q$ is a better **approximation** of $P$, while a **higher** value indicates a larger **difference** between the two distributions.
	* The KL divergence from distribution $Q$ to distribution $P$ is defined as : $D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) = \sum_{i} P(i) \log\left(\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}\right)$
		* $D_{KL}(P \parallel Q)$ :  The divergence from $Q$ to $P$, representing the "distance" between the two distributions.
		* This KL divergence measures the **loss** when **modeling** using $Q$ assuming the **data** comes from $P$. 
	* For continuous distributions, the KL divergence is given by : $D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) \log\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right) \, dx$


* ##### ✨ Cross-Entropy
	* **Cross-entropy loss** is a commonly used loss function in classification tasks. It measures the difference between two probability distributions: the **true distribution** (the ground truth labels) and the **predicted distribution** (the model's output). 
	* The goal of minimizing cross-entropy loss is to make the predicted distribution as close as possible to the true distribution.
	* For a single data point, given a true label $y$ (a one-hot encoded vector) and a predicted probability distribution $\hat{y}$​, the cross-entropy loss is defined as: $\mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y}) = - \sum_{i=1}^{C} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)$
		* $C$ is the number of classes.
		- $y_i$​ is the true label for class $i$ (either 0 or 1 in one-hot encoding).
		- $\hat{y}_i$​ is the predicted probability for class $i$.
		- $\log(\hat{y}_i))$ is the logarithm of the predicted probability for class $i$.
	- Cross-Entropy in **Binary Classification**
		In binary classification (two classes, $C=2$), cross-entropy loss can be simplified to: $\mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y}) = - \left( y \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y}) \right)$
		* Where:
			- $y \in \{0, 1\}$ is the true label.
			- $\hat{y} \in [0, 1]$ is the predicted probability for the positive class
		- This is also known as the **binary cross-entropy** loss and is commonly used in logistic regression and binary classification tasks.
